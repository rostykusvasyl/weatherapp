Weatherapp is a program for displaying weather information from sites: accuweather.com/, rp5.ua/ and sinoptik.ua/. All weather information is displayed in the console. You can also set the location for which you want to see the weather information in the configuration of the program. The program is implemented in such a way that it is possible to add a new weather provider as a plug-in.
